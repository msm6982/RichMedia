        <h2 class="subtitle has-text-weight-bold mb-0">Noteworthy</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I poured a significant into making the most engaging storm/lightning-themed Audio Visualizer</li>
          <li>It took an extreme deal of balance in values and effects to make the AV realistically chaotic to actual storms while still giving the user a sence of the song beat</li>
          <li>While I did take some slight inspiration and help from my cited resource for rain and flash generation, the lightning display is all my own creation and with both I heavily altered these display to adhere to the theme of my project</li>
          <li>My control variance is far above the required amount and all of them speak to the project and it's theme, no repeat of previous AV hw</li>
          <li>My json file and use is extensive and detailed for loading in customizable default values for the project</li>
          <li>I frequently combed over bugs related to the controls and Canvas display, leading to none that at all noticeable </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="subtitle has-text-weight-bold mb-0">Grading</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Going through the grading rubric I believe that my overall grade should be around the B B+ range, while not the most impressive AV (comparing it to some of the best of the AV showcase) it still proves an engaging experience while adhering to the storm theming</li>
          <li>I meet all the minimum technical and impact requirements as outlined in the rubric, and even go beyond with differentiating my project in controls and options form previous AV demos and homework</li>
          <li>While the extreme randomness and even busies is a factor of the project which can hamper impact it is a testament to my balancing and design skills to stick to this hard to work with theme and still make an extremely engaging and interactive experience </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="subtitle has-text-weight-bold mb-0">To-Do</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Dedicate a bit more time making the styling of the web pages more unique: Similar to P1 I was more primary focusing on functionality for the project. Web styling is ultimately my kryptonite so more time is needed when I can afford it </li>
          <li>Figure out more methods to tone down the overall randomness: Randomness was a pretty defining theme of my project given that "lightning doesn't strike twice" however that isn't to say that everything is completely random and there are various controls to mitigate the randomness</li>
          <li>"Random events": Despite the project visuals being highly random it's still relatively quick to recognize some patterns, this was mitigated through the variety of options and the song tracks themselves providing various highs and lows of beats and sounds which the visuals sync up to.</li>
          <li>Clouds: Time constraints prevented me from adding clouds in a meaningful way, ultimately the feature I'm most disappointed in not getting to, there's a lot of controls already so it's not the worst thing</li>
        </ul>
